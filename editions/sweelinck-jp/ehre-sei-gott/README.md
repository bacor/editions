# Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck (attrib.) — Ehre sei Gott

The piece is attributed to Sweelinck in Profe’s Geistlicher Concerten und Harmonien, but this
is questionable, and the work has not been included in Sweelincks _Opera Omnia_ (1968).

All parts are from the 1641 edition, published by Christoph Jacob (Breslau) and printed by
Henning Köler in Leipzig. Two digitized version have been consulted:

- PL-Kj Mus.ant.pract. P 1395 (jbc.bj.uj.edu.pl/publication/294205) all parts
- D-KA Mus. Hs. 92 (digital.blb-karlsruhe.de/id/1071915) cantus 2, altus, bassus, and b.c.
