# Alessandro Melani — Quae est ista

## Source

This is not a critical edition, but a diplomatic edition of
_Concerti Spirituali_, op. 3. Rome: Vitale Mascardi, 1682.
A single source was used: the scans available via IMSLP of Museo
internazionale e Bibl. della musica, Bologna (I-Bc): RISM
A/I: M-2214.

## Editorial conventions

Spelling has been standardized: & ➝ et, æ ➝ ae, u ➝ v (e.g., nouæ ➝ novae).
Modern hyphenation has been used (e.g. plau-de-te instead of pla-ude-te). Comma’s have been
inserted after repeated words (there are no comma’s in the source). The word ‘Maria’
always appears capitalized in the source, otherwise capitalization is retained. The
placement of the text is sometimes ambiguous. In particular, ‘gaudete’ and ‘ridete’ are
consistently placed so that ‘de’ lands on the first beat of a bar

## Editorial comments

- C1, m. 24, note 2: F ➝ E
- C1, m. 38: the slur is unclear, but consistent with the text.
- C1, m. 47, note 1: F ➝ D
- C1, m. 59: F ➝ F#.
- C1, m. 68: text placement is unclear.
- C1, m. 174–176: suggested alternative text placement.
- C1, m. 226–228: suggested alternative text placement.
- C2, m. 29: ‘te’ placed on last note instead of Nrst (cf. C1)
- C2, m. 119, last note: G# ➝ G.
- C2, m. 141: the slur and the text placement in the source seem inconsistent. Alternatively, drop the slur and use the same text placement as in the other voices.
- A, m. 180, note 2: F ➝ F# Ncta.
- A, m. 179: the slur to m. 180 appears a bar too early in the source. Added a slur between 180 and 181 for consistency with other voices.
- T, m. 80, note 2: F ➝ E.
- B, m. 216: last note is a minim in the source, replaced with a
  semibreve.
- Org, m. 102: the flats in the continuo are transcribed as naturals
